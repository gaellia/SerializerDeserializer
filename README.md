# SerializerDeserializer
A "fun" reflection exercise from CPSC 501 where objects are being created, serialized into an xml, sent over a network, and deserialized on the receiving end.

Uses fun objects based on the great 90s phenomenon Pok√©mon.

## Usage
  1. Change server address in "Sender.java" depending on localhost or other machine
  2. Compile everything
  3. Start "Receiver" on host
  4. Start "Sender" on client
  5. Enter object details and hit send
  6. Watch magic happen on the host

## Testing
Testing was done with IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2.2 with OpenJDK 16 (1.8)
